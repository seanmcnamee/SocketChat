# SocketChat

This is meant to run multiple instances AFTER the server-side is running.

The default code only works locally. To alter the IP (hostname) and PORT, you must change 'hostname' and 'port' in the ChatClient class in this code AND change the 'port' variable in the ChatServer class of the server-side code. (A different repository) You'll have to change the hostname to match the external IP of the computer that is running the server-side code.
